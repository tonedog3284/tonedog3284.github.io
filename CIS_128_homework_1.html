My name is Tony Girard and I am 34 years old. I have a 15 year old daughter named Jordan. My greatest passion is sports. I love to watch football, baseball and basketball. I still play basketball once or twice a week, as well as surf occasionally. I bartend for a living at an Italian restaurant close to where I live. </p>
<br>
<p>I am attending this class to grow my knowledge in computer coding. I am still very new to coding, but I have really enjoyed what I've learned so far. I hope to one day write computer code as a career. </p>
