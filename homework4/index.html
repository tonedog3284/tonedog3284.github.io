        You might be asking: what exactly is a Progressive Web App?
        Well, let me explain. Often referred to as PWA's, Progressive Web
        Apps are applications for your phone, tablet, laptop or home computer
        that operate very similar to apps you download from an app store
        (also known as native apps). The biggest difference between a PWA
        and a native app resides in the development side of things. When
        developing a native app, you will have different code written for
        different devices (i.e. Android and Apple). This creates challenges
        for the developers as well as the company producing the app. The
        developer will essentually be writting two applications, which in
        turn will drive up the cost of production. This is where PWA's can
        save the day!
        </p>

        <p>
        PWA's are written with just one set of code, regardless of the
        type of device it will be operating on. PWA's are written in HTML
        format, meaning that they opperate the same way a website does.
        There are a few differences between a PWA and traditional website,
        the biggest being that you can download a PWA directly to your device.
        By doing this, the user will have a hard copy of the application's
        content stored on their device the same way a native app is downloaded.
        This allows the user to operate the app with or without an internet
        connection, all while using less storage space on their device. All in
        all, PWA's are a great choice whether you are the company producing
        the app or the consumer putting it to use.
